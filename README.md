# CoBuildr
CoBuildr proposes a multifaceted approach to address the challenges faced by college students in forming project teams. Using Flutter, the application will provide a user-friendly interface that integrates social networking and project management. CoBuildr will limit the user base to college students, avoiding security concerns. Instead of Tinder-like user profiles, users can create project profiles to match with possible team members. Users pitch their ideas without fearing verbal rejection, only finding individuals interested in their project. Students will also create personal profiles with their skills and interests. CoBuildr will analyze this data, suggesting projects to compatible team members. By swiping left and right, students can discover numerous projects and individuals, creating an environment conducive for collaboration. Compared to clubs and classrooms, students will avoid anxiety-inducing conversations, commit less time, and find more projects.
